Documentation

We are aiming at providing a library with the **standard data model** as outlined in the [**Dialogue Standard Exchange Format**](../../README.md#dialogue-standard-exchange-format). This is a community work in progress and part of the [**Libre Gaming Manifest**](https://github.com/LibreGamingManifest), a larger effort aiming at enabling creative and community oriented collaborators to create interesting games by providing the necessary libre tools to do so.
